IPdemy IPAM is a free and opensource IP address management tool that effectively monitors IP Address. It is intended to function as a domain-specific source of truth for network operations.

IPdemy IPAM runs as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a PostgreSQL database. For a complete list of requirements, see requirements.txt. The code is available on GitHub.

The IP Address Management tool periodically scans a subnet and single IP's and provides the availability status of IP addresses in that subnet. 

The complete documentation for IPdemy IPAM can be found at Read the Docs.
